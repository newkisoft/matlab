%         c1 and c2 are 2-vectors specifying the centres of the two circles.
%         r1 and r2 are the radii of the two circles.
%         lr is a character 'l' or 'r' indicating whether one wants the solution
%         to the left or right of the line from c1 to c2
%         P is desired one of the two 2D intersection points (if they exist)

function P = circleIntersect(c1, r1, c2, r2, lr)
